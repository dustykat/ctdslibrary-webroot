Propose a basic design for a jet system that would make such a recirculating system work for a channel $8$ ft wide and $4$ ft deep. That is determine the nozzle diameter, speed, and number of nozzles. The design should specify nominal diameters of nozzles using commercially available pipes (1-in., 2-in, ...).
