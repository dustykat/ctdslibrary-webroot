# CECE Downstream Problem 

This prototype website is intended as a collection of worked examples for faculty in CECE to use to incorporate Nature Inspired Design, Computational Thinking, and Social Technological issues into the CECE curriculum.

## Background

The WCOE mandates a common first year experience, the three formal courses in that experience are:

- ENGR 1330 Computational Thinning and Data Science
- ENGR 1320 Biologically Inspired Design (Nature Inspired Design)
- ENGR 2392 Engineering Ethics and Its Impact on Society (Social Technological)

Downstream use of the concepts in these course is thematically expected, and will serve to ...

In searching the literature the developers found lots of philosophy and citations back to untraceable documents on the subjects (main focus on the first two) but no examples -- NONE!  

So this collection is a start.

## Audience
This collection is intended for faculty to leverage concetps in the Year 1 common theme in later courses.  
The concept is one or two homework assignments, appropriatly chosen, where students are tasked with using the tools they developed in the first year experience.

Suitable exercises are:

- Read and summarize a case study; identify and critique ethical conflicts, unanticipated impacts on society 
- Convert ordinary homework problems into computational thinking exercises
- Identify similarities in currect design methods to nature inspired design (assuming nature is an energy minimization process)
- 

This prototype library is built on a Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB) running Ubuntu 20.XX.
