# Social/Technical Issues in Engineering

This is an essay/critical thinking and literature synthesis problem that employs features from Computational Thinking (the domain context) and Social/Technological and ethics issues.

Recall how to run a YouTube video from a Jupyter Notebook


```python
from IPython.display import YouTubeVideo
YouTubeVideo('-7gVqBY52MY')
```

Watch the video above (~15 minutes). Then read an accompanying account of the incidents revealed in the Video at [Therac25-Accidents](http://54.243.252.9/engr-1330-webroot/3-Readings/therac.pdf) or [N. G. Leveson and C. S. Turner, "An investigation of the Therac-25 accidents," in Computer, vol. 26, no. 7, pp. 18-41, July 1993, doi: 10.1109/MC.1993.274940.  ](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/274940) 

Identify three social/technological issues/mistakes illustrated by the accidents?

Were the accidents a failure of engineering? If so how?

Were the accidents a failure of management at the manufacturer and/or the therapy centers?

What similar situation can you imagine in a Civil, Construction, or Enviornmental Engineering context (its ok to speculate)
